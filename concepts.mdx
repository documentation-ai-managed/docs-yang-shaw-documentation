## Platform Architecture

The platform follows a scalable, microservices-based design. Client applications connect via REST APIs to services handling messaging, scheduling, and analytics. A central database stores user data and campaign history.

    A[Client App] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Email Service]
    B --> D[SMS Service]
    B --> E[Analytics Service]
    C --> F[Database]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

This architecture ensures high availability and easy scaling. You interact primarily through the API gateway.

## User Roles and Permissions

Different roles grant specific access levels. Use the following tabs to review permissions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Admin" icon="shield">
    Full access: Manage users, campaigns, billing, and platform settings.
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="API,CLI">
    ```javascript
    // Check role via API
    const userRole = await fetch('/api/user/role');
    console.log(userRole.role); // "admin"
    ```
    ```bash
    # CLI command
    cheney role check --user-id 123
    # Output: admin
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Editor" icon="edit">
    Create and edit campaigns, view analytics, but no user management.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only access to campaigns and reports.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced Permissions" default-open="false">
  Customize permissions with granular controls like `campaign:delete` or `analytics:export`. Assign via the admin dashboard.
